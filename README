Tagger is a personal website and blog management system

I wrote Tagger as a playground for web development and I use it to run my
website. Even though there are tons of very good CMS and blog softwares
out there, Tagger has a few features that can be nice for a developer:

  * it's written in python
  * it's based on TurboGears
  * it's multi-lingual
  * uses reStructuredText
  * saves pages edits
  * it's open source

So if you are an adventurous python web developer and want a hand-made,
custom-built, DIY-style, original and definitely cool tool for your own
website... give Tagger a try!

And if you like it, help me fix it and improve it ;)

Installation and Setup
======================

Intall Turbogears 2.1 following the instructions at
http://www.turbogears.org/2.1/docs/main/DownloadInstall.html

Install ``tagger`` using the setup.py script::

    $ cd tagger
    $ python setup.py install

Create the project database for any model classes defined::

    $ paster setup-app development.ini

Start the paste http server::

    $ paster serve development.ini

While developing you may want the server to reload after changes in package
files (or its dependencies) are saved. This can be achieved easily by adding the
--reload option::

    $ paster serve --reload development.ini

Then you are ready to go.
